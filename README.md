Workshop-Addon-Bug
==================

I got the Garrys mod through Steam, and after downloading some addons in workshop, I came across one called Enhanced Facepose, install it after I tried it and did not like, and you uninstall it, but the problem is that even after eliminated aver addon even persisted, contact the creator of this addon, but I said no problem abia had to uninstall it, and told me if it was revised in the addons folder to delete it (at least that I understood that said ). This bothers me to do faceposing, which I do a good faceposing impossible, I hope to get answers to my problem, thank you very much for your attention.
